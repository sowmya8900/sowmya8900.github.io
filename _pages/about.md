I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Utah, advised by Prof. Manish Parashar at the Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute. My research focuses on high-performance computing, benchmarking, workflow analysis, and large-scale data management. I am passionate about optimizing scientific workflows and analyzing communication impacts in large-scale scientific applications.

Previously, I earned my MS in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign under Prof. Laxmikant (Sanjay) Kale, and my B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, India.
